# Valtech.Automation
I created a basic BDD driven test automation framework and uploaded it in the Section 2 as there is no provision to enter my git url.

The specflow features a Test feature that included scenario for all the three tests case. The feature file has its own test step implementation.

The framework is a page object model framework, which includes its default cases like launching a page from a generic basepage class and page specific implementation in the custom page class objects.Launching the driver will be handles in the Basedriver which acts as a manager to launch and shutdown the drivers whilst there is a dedicated driver funcitonality customise to my custom needs

i tried to demonstrate the various assert techninques with the available examples and included the tag based run in the script as well. Apart from that due to the time restriction, I made it as a XPATH driven testcase. This can be further improvised into a pageobjectfactories to ease the lengthy lines of code to perform specific action items.



Running the tests:

Compiling the code should display the testcases in the Unit test explorer module. As tagging is provided for demonstration purpose only, select feature based unit test execution from the drop down and can run the test case.

The output will be display in the unit test explore window itself.
